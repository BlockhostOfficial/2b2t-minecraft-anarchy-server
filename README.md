# List of the best Minecraft Anarchy Servers in 2024

2b2t has been the leading anarchy server with the title of the oldest anarchy server until 2020. The admin of 2b2t Hausemaster started banning and muting players for a variety of reasons, such as insulting him in chat, building lag machines and trapping new players. In 2023, the rules were made official on the 2b2t website, however the list is incomplete and you can find the full list of 2b2t rules [here](https://blog.6b6t.org/the-rules-of-2b2t/). Players are punished with mutes, usernames bans as well as IP bans on 2b2t. Currently 500+ players are either banned or muted on the server.

## Which anarchy server should I join instead?

Since 2b2t might not be the best choice for players who fear getting banned, for doing things that should be allowed, I've compiled a list of the best servers you can join instead.

### 6b6t

Since the fall of 2b2t, Minecraft server 6b6t became the most popular anarchy server where there are truly no rules. 100+ players are online every single day and the server is popular for the semi-vanilla commands /tpa and /home. It offers an alternative gameplay to 2b2t, with new commands and new features added to the server. It runs on special technology, a heavy fork of software Folia, which allows for 1000 players to join before the queue starts.
